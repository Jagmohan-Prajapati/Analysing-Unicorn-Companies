                <p class="secTag textBig">Canva</p>
                <p class="secSubtag textSmall">Web-based design platform Canva is introducing a colossal suite of new
                    brand management products and AI-powered design tools focused on helping entire workplaces
                    streamline their content creation process. Announced today at Canva’s Create event, most of these
                    new features are designed to make creating content like social media graphics, presentations, and
                    advertising materials more accessible to those without professional design experience. The idea is
                    this would leave graphic designers free to tackle more pressing tasks. The number of features
                    announced is impressive and could challenge Adobe’s ubiquity in some offices.
                    <br>
                    A new Brand Hub is being added to Canva’s Visual Worksuite, providing tools meant to help users
                    remain consistent with their organizations’ visual identity. Instead of a shared drive and endless
                    Slack messages to designers, users would now create a Brand Kit with company-specific assets like
                    logos, fonts, colors, and design guidelines. Brand Folders would be set up to group assets together
                    for specific events, campaigns, and projects, and Brand Templates would allow designers to create
                    pre-branded reusable templates for more repetitive tasks like email campaigns.

                    Ritesh Agarwal-led Oravel Stays Ltd, the company which operates brand OYO, has ruled out discussions
                    pertaining to withdrawal of IPO papers from the Securities Exchange Board of India.
                    <br>
                    According to the Economic Times report, Oravel Stays Ltd has also been discussing with private
                    market investors to raise more funds in the next six-eight months.
                    In 2023, the market regulator had returned the IPO filing by OYO, requiring the Softbank-backed firm
                    to refile its draft red herring prospectus with updates and revisions.

                <p class="secTag textBig">CRED</p>
                <p class="secSubtag textSmall">Kunal Shah-led fintech unicorn CRED announced on February 6 the
                    acquisition of online financial planning and investment platform Kuvera, in a mix of cash and stock
                    deal.
                    <br>
                    The acquisition is touted as Cred’s entry into the wealth management space as the fintech firm looks
                    to leverage Kuvera’s 3 lakh-active “affluent” investor community for cross sell opportunity, while
                    offering its own users with newer financial products alongside payments, loans and insurance.
                    <br>
                    Among all, mutual funds and fixed deposits (FD) stand out to be the most popular, besides other
                    offerings like SIPs, international equities (commercial arrangement with Vested Inc), pension fund,
                    and digital gold.
                    <br>
                    Having said that, it remains unknown as to how Cred would monetise on Kuvera’s products as most of
                    them, expect FDs, attract limited to zero fee.

                <p class="secSubtag textSmall">The National Basketball Association (NBA) and the Women’s National
                    Basketball Association (WNBA) on February 12 announced a multiyear extension of its partnership with
                    fantasy sports major Dream11 to bolster the sport's presence in India.
                    <br>
                    This partnership will see Dream11 continue as the official fantasy gaming partner of the NBA and
                    WNBA in the country. NBA had first partnered with Dream11 for the 2017-18 basketball season and
                    launched the league's first official fantasy game in India.
                    <br>
                    Through this tie-up, Indian consumers will be able to compete in a range of public and private NBA
                    and WNBA-themed fantasy contests on Dream11 daily. They will get to build a virtual team of NBA or
                    WNBA players and accumulate points based on the players’ real-life on-court performances. Users will
                    be able to compete in both free and paid contests on the platform.
                    <br>
                    “With India being one of the fastest growing markets in the world for fantasy gaming, bolstering our
                    presence in this space has been a key focus for us over the last few years,” said NBA India Country
                    Head Rajah Chaudhry.

                <p class="secSubtag textSmall">Eyewear retailer Lenskart’s return to the black in FY23 became possible
                    by scaling up the business by investing heavily in setting up its largest automated eyewear factory
                    in Bhiwadi, Rajasthan, co-founder and product head Ramneek Khurana told Fe. He said that the company
                    will continue to post profit in the current fiscal also.
                    <br>
                    “Unit-economics wise we have been always profitable. We have done a lot of investment in the new
                    facility which has come up. So, year-over-year it was just about getting to the right scale,”
                    Khurana said.
                    <br>
                    Lenskart swung back to a profit of Rs 260 crore in FY23, from a loss of Rs 100 crore in FY22, as its
                    topline more than doubled to Rs 3,780 crore from Rs 1,503 crore in the preceding year, its CEO
                    Peyush Bansal had earlier said.
